                    <li><strong>Study title:</strong> Accuracy of personal information from Crowdflower workers</li>
                    <li><strong>Researcher:</strong> Huw Fryer and Tom Blount</li>

                Please read this information carefully before deciding to take part in this research.  It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you are happy to participate you will be asked to sign a consent form.
            </p>
            <h2>What is the research about?</h2>
            <p>
                This is a project by researchers at the University of Southampton, who wish to explore the accuracy of information provided in response to online surveys in relation to personal data.  The project is funded by the EU Horizon 2020 scheme, and is sponsored by the University of Southampton.
                In this study, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire which provides personal information, for which the accuracy will be verified as far as possible.
            </p>
            <h2>Why have I been asked to participate?</h2>
            <p>
                You have been asked to participate, because you responded to a task listing on the Crowdflower website, and you have had a Facebook account for at least 3 months.
            </p>

            <h2>What will happen to me if I take part?</h2>
            <p>You will be asked to answer questions in a short survey, which we will then attempt to verify the accuracy of.  In the event that the answers are accurate, you will be paid the fee offered for participating in the survey.</p>
            <p>We expect that the study will take two minutes of your time to complete.</p>
            <p>Should you wish, you may ask to receive further information about the study following its completion.  We will send you an email adding further information, and expected publications.</p>

            <h2>Are there any benefits in my taking part?</h2>
            <p>
            For taking part, you will be rewarded with the fee advertised for taking the microtask.
            </p>

            <h2>Are there any risks involved?</h2>
            <p>
            There are no physical risks in taking part, although you might feel some psychological discomfort in answering some of the questions.  You are also providing sensitive information which could be used against you, and as such there is a small risk of economic harm.
            </p>

            <h2></h2>
            <p>
            Your participation will be confidential.  We will collect no personal information, because we only wish to obtain general demographic information.  Any answers you give will never be stored on our server, but will instead simply increase the count for people in a particular demographic.

            </p>

            <h2>What should I do if I want to take part?</h2>
            <p>
If you wish to take part, you should tick the first question to say you have read and understood this participant information sheet.
            </p>

            <h2>What happens if I change my mind?</h2>
            <p>
            You may withdraw from the study if you decide that you do not wish to answer a question, although we will deem it an unsatisfactory completion of the task, and may decline to pay you.  Following submission of your password, you may no longer withdraw from that part of the study, since a script will be run which cannot be reversed.
            </p>
            <p>
            Note that since the study is fully anonymised, you cannot withdraw after completion of the study, since we have no way of verifying which information is yours.
            </p>

            <h2>What will happen to the results of the research?</h2>
            <p>
The results will be analysed, and submitted to a journal or conference for publication.  The policy of the University of Southampton is that all publications be made “open access”, so you will be able to read it. If you opt in to receive further information, we will contact you when the study has been published.
            </p>
            <p>
                The research data will not be made available for further research projects, but the [fully anonymised] data will be made available on the institutional repository.
            </p>
